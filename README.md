# ShinoProxy

ShinoProxy is a PHP program for proxying ShinoBOT traffic.  
ShinoBOT is a BOT/RAT simulator; visit [shinobot.com](http://shinobot.com/) for details.

## How to use
Copy the index.php to your apache root directory.  
Now your server becomes ShinoProxy. Non-ShinoBOT traffic like browser will be redirect to top.php.   
Prepare top.php if you want to take care of those traffic.
